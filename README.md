# 🌱 Tech Tree Root (TTR)

**Tech Tree Root (TTR)** is a personal, feature-driven project where I bring together software, hardware, and AI tools into one structured system. Inspired by the idea of a tech tree, each part of the project builds on the last — with clear goals, feature unlocks, and growing complexity.

This is not just a Unity project — it connects **multiple technologies**, including programming, IoT, AI, embedded systems, and electrical control.

## 🎯 Project Vision

TTR is where I:
- Build and connect projects across multiple platforms
- Explore new tools and technologies
- Develop features with a clear, goal-based path
- Track how systems evolve and depend on each other

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Programming**: C, C++, Python, JavaScript, Dart (Flutter)
- **AI**: ML models, smart logic integration (planned)
- **Game Dev**: Unity (C#), real-time visual systems
- **Embedded Systems**: Arduino, microcontrollers, sensors
- **IoT & Control**: Device integration, smart hardware control
- **Dev Tools**: Visual Studio, VS Code, Unity

---

## 🚧 Current Focus

- Unity foundation setup  
- Basic tech node logic  
- Planning hardware-software interaction  
- Uploading experiments and new features regularly

---

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

- Game feature trees in Unity  
- AI-enhanced systems  
- IoT devices communicating with game logic  
- Embedded control systems (lights, motors, sensors)  
- Cross-platform experimentation and learning
